# MechaCar Analysis
Statistical analysis of an automobile performance using R.

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to perform statistical analysis on a prototype automobile's data. The insights uncovered are set to assist the manufacturing team on necessary improvements.
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Some main concerns we set out to answer throughout the analysis:
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

#### Results
* The most significant variables in the details that show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCare are the vehicle_length and ground_clearance. The analysis provided p-values of 2.6x10^-12 and 5.21x10^-8, respectively.
